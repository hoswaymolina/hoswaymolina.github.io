## Data Analytics

#### [Debt and Development in the Levant: Jordan and the World Bank](/bank)

In this project, I utilized SQL to uncover aggregations from almost 1.5 million rows as I evaluated Jordan's standing with the World Bank.

I analyzed over 2000 rows of food delivery data using Microsoft Excel. I practiced Pivot tables, pivot charts, aggregation functions, and cleaning techniques among other things. I made the write-up in a LinkedIn article.

In this case study from Data Analytics Accelerator, I was prompted to analyze the State of Massachusetts education data. The main focuses were: What schools are struggling the most? How does class size affect college admission? What are the top math schools in the state?

### [Indiana University REU Project: Cubulated Holonomy](files/Cubulated_Holonomy_REU_report.pdf)
[<img src="images/REUfig.png?raw=true"/>](files/Cubulated_Holonomy_REU_report.pdf)
[Stephanie Atherton](https://linktr.ee/toyTeX) and I collaborated on this NSF-funded research project in summer 2024! We focused on the following research question: given the holonomy group of the cube on a surface made of squares, what subgroups can we obtain by varying the surface? We used abstract algebra and algebraic topology to find out.
